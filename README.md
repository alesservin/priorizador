## Running the API locally

For Python=3.7

To use the api you should create a virtual environment with python, install virtualenv with pip
`pip install virtualenv`
Then redirect yourself to the flask_api folder and create an env folder
`cd flask_api/ && mkdir env`
Last, create the virtual environment and install the requirements
`python -m venv env && pip install -r requirements.txt`
Download the geojson file and put it on the geojson_data folder, then execute the script.
`python geojson_api.py`

### Deploy with docker-compose

Install docker (minimun 17.05) and docker-compose in your local environment.

Execute
`docker-compose build`
`docker-compose up -d`

For production deployment you should change the localhost and port 8080 with your port and servername int the nginx_config files.
